Q: What is the Two Pot Retirement system, and how does it differ from the current retirement 
system in South Africa?  
A: The Two Pot Retirement system is a proposed change to South Africa's retirement savings 
structure to improve financial security and encourage long term retirement savings. In this system, 
your retirement contributions will be divided into two pots: a "Savings Pot", which is the allocation 
to your lump sum at retirement, where one third of your contributions will be allocated, and a 
"Retirement Pot", where the remaining two thirds will be kept for funding your income in retirement. 
Members will be able to  access the savings pot before retirement if required. The Retirement Pot 
will be preserved until the retirement date.  
 
Q: When will this new system start, and what are the transition plans?  
A: The effective date is 1 September 2024. Your current retirement savings will not be impacted and 
will be governed by the old rules up until that date.  
 
Q: What's the rationale behind the Two Pot Retirement system?  
A: National Treasury proposed the Two Pot Retirement system to provide a solution for South 
Africans who struggle financially due to a lack of "rainy day" funds. The system allows for a portion 
of retirement savings to be accessed in real emergencies while  promoting the preservation of most 
of the savings until retirement.  
According to estimates by National Treasury, less than 6% of South Africans retire comfortably, and 
one of the main reasons behind this alarming statistic is that people cash out their pensions when 
changing jobs. The new legislation will remove the ability to access retirement funds when changing 
jobs.  
The new rules, however, will only apply to new contributions after 1 September 2024. All retirement 
savings as of the effective date will be ringfenced as the "Vested Pot", and the existing rules will 
continue to apply.  
 
Q: How will the Two Pot Retirement system function in practice?  
A: From 1 September 2024 your retirement fund contributions will go into two pots � a savings pot 
and a retirement pot. One third of your contributions will go into the savings pot, which you can 
access once a tax year if needed. The remaining two thirds will go into the retirement pot, which 
you will not be able to touch until you retire.  
Members of retirement funds can apply directly to their pension fund administrators to access 
withdrawals from their savings pot.  
  
Q: How does the Savings Pot of the Two Pot Retirement system work, and what are the rules?  
A: The Savings Pot of the Two Pot Retirement system is effectively a ringfencing of a member's lump 
sum at retirement. You can access money from the Savings Pot before you retire, but only once a 
year. The minimum withdrawal amount from the savings pot is R2 000. There is no maximum 
amount.  
Anything withdrawn from your Savings Pot will be included in your taxable income for that year and 
taxed at your applicable marginal rate.  
 
A retirement income benefit is used to provide you with monthly income.  
When accessing your Savings Pot, the following must be considered:  
 A minimum of R2 000 can be withdrawn; if you have less than R2 000 in the Savings Pot, you 
cannot withdraw.  
 You can only withdraw once in a tax year, i.e., between 1 March and 28 February each year.  
 There is no maximum withdrawal amount.  
 You will be charged an administration fee for the withdrawal, which will be deducted from the 
amount you want to withdraw.  
 You will pay tax on the Savings Pot withdrawal benefit based on your individual marginal tax rate as 
supplied by SARS.  
 In a pension or provident fund, on resignation, you can only cash out your Savings Pot if it is less 
than R2 000 or you have not already accessed your one withdrawal per tax year. Otherwise, you will 
be required to preserve this benefit in the same way y ou will preserve your Retirement Pot benefit.  
 
Q: Which tax tables will apply to the Savings Pot withdrawal?  
A: Your marginal tax rate is determined by SARS and your income  the higher your income, the 
higher your marginal tax rate.  
If you withdraw from your Savings Pot, Finanacial Institution will request a tax directive from SARS. 
The amount that SARS provides to Finanacial Institution will be the amount that Finanacial 
Institution will deduct from the amount you have asked for (alo ng with any fees).  
The tax tables in this attachment show the difference between the marginal tax rate (which is what 
you will be charged if you withdraw from your Savings Pot before you retire) and the retirement tax 
rate, which is the rate that you will be taxed on your lu mp sum withdrawal at retirement.  
  
Q: How does the seeding  the amount that will be transferred to the Savings Pot  work?  
A: The legislation indicates that from 1 September 2024, a maximum of 10%, capped at R30 000, of 
the member's existing savings will be used to seed the accessible Savings Pot. This allocation to the 
Savings Pot will be automatic. However, you do not need to access this money immediately. If you 
do not access the funds immediately, they will continue to be invested in your Savings Pot and earn 
an investment return.  
 
Q: Is there sufficient liquidity in regulation 28 portfolios to manage withdrawals from the Savings 
Pot?  
A: Regulation 28 portfolios have sufficient liquidity to manage withdrawals from the Savings Pot. 
The conditions suggested of a 10% limit, capped at R30 000, mean that funds can seamlessly 
navigate any liquidity issues that may have arisen had the quantum has been significant. The 
manageable seeding will have minimal impact on the liquidity requirements of retirement funds.  
 
Q: Are there any RA products that have been excluded?  
A: Yes, the legislation enables legacy retirement annuity funds to apply for exemption from two pot 
requirements.  
 
Q: How will the Two Pot Retirement system affect members of provident funds who were over 55 as 
of 1 March 2021?  
A: These members were ringfenced and given vested rights to their benefit when the new 
annuitisation rule changes were implemented on 1 March 2021. According to the current 
proposals, they can continue contributing to their vested provident fund pot as the y have been. 
Alternatively, they can opt to move into the new Two Pot Retirement System.  
Members who fall into this category will receive detailed communication on this option as we get 
closer to the implementation date. It will be critical for these members to speak to their financial 
adviser to ensure they fully understand the choice that wi ll be given to them.  
 
Q: Will the Two Pot Retirement system lead to an increase in administration fees?  
A: Given the additional administration required to handle the new Two Pot Retirement system, 
there may be changes to administration costs. If there is any change, it will be communicated to 
members.  
 
Q: What happens when I leave my organisation?  
A: Old rules will apply to your retirement savings accumulated as at 1 September. You will still have 
access to some of your accumulated retirement funds (which will be in your vested pot) when you 
leave  one third of your investment (as at 1 September) c an be taken as cash. You can also access 
what is in your Savings Pot if you leave after September 2024.  
  
Q: What happens if I'm retrenched?  
A: Old rules will apply to retirement savings pre September 2024.If you have a pension fund you can 
take one third in cash (you'll have to pay tax and fees) and invest your two thirds in your new 
company's pension/provident fund or a retirement annuity. If  you have a provident fund, you can 
take your retirement savings as cash subject to tax. You will also be able to access the money in 
your Savings Pot, provided you haven't accessed the Savings Pot in that particular Tax Year.  
 
Q: If I leave my current employment in December 2024 can I cash in my full Vested Pot (the money I 
have saved up until 31 August 2024)?  
A: If you have a pension fund and you resign, you will be able to access all the money in your Vested 
Pot as well as what is in your Savings Pot (provided that you did not make any prior withdrawal from 
your Savings Pot)  
 
Q: What are the long term effects of Two Pot?  
A: Currently, members of pension and provident funds can cash out 100% of their retirement 
savings when they change jobs, and we know that most people do this. This is one of the primary 
reasons members do not have sufficient money at retirement. In the ne w system, only one third of 
your savings will be accessible. Two thirds of your savings, allocated to your retirement will not be 
accessible until retirement. We believe this change will result in members achieving better 
retirement outcomes in the long te rm. 
In addition, the Two Pot Retirement system provides a solution for South Africans who struggle 
financially due to a lack of "rainy day" funds. The system allows for a portion of retirement savings 
to be accessed in real emergencies while promoting the pres ervation of most of the savings until 
retirement.  
 
Q: LEGISLATION  FOR THE TWO POT SYSTEM  
A: The National Treasury released the set of four draft Tax Bills for public comment on 29 July 2022, 
which give effect to the 2022 Budget tax proposals. These include the 2022 Draft Rates and 
Monetary Amounts and Amendment of Revenue Laws Bill (2022 Draft  Rates Bill), the 2022 Draft 
Revenue Laws Amendment Bill, the 2022 Draft Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (2022 Draft TLAB) 
and the 2022 Draft Tax Administration Laws Amendment Bill (2022 Draft TALAB).  
The 2022 Draft Revenue Laws Amendment Bill contains key amendments on retirement reform to 
move towards a �two pot� retirement system. The amendments enable South Africans to also save 
for nonretirement purposes (e.g. emergencies) via their retirement fun ds, whilst preserving more of 
their savings for retirement. These amendments aim to encourage members to preserve their 
retirement savings by making it more flexible to accommodate unforeseen pressures that members 
face during the span of their working life. It makes it possible for workers not to resign from their 
employment merely to access their retirement funds and would have assisted members during a 
crisis like the COVID 19 pandemic, when many employees faced r educed salaries or were not paid 
at all during that time.  
The legislative proposals follow an intensive process of consultations, where various risks, 
challenges and possible perverse outcomes were identified. These amendments are the 
culmination of several years of consultations and engagements that took place b etween National 
Treasury, Labour, and Business stakeholders, and reflects input received from the public after the 
release of the discussion paper Encouraging households to save more for retirement in December 
2021. The amendments are technically complex, as they attempt to fit a pre retirement withdrawal 
scheme into existing retirement savings vehicles primarily meant to cater for long term savings.  
Process to enact Bills following public comments  
The process for enacting any amendments following publication involves taking public comments. 
After receipt of written comments, National Treasury normally engages with stakeholders through 
public workshops to discuss the written comments on the draft bil l. The Standing Committee on 
Finance (SCoF) and the Select Committee on Finance (SeCoF) in Parliament are expected to make 
a similar call for public comment and convene public hearings on the 2022 draft bills before their 
formal introduction inParliament. Thereafter, a response document on the comments received will 
be presented at the Parliamentary committee hearings, after which the bills will then be revised, 
taking into account public comments and recommendations made during committee hearings, 
before they are introduced formally in Parliament for its consideration.  
 
Q: LEGISLATION  Background  
A: South Africa has different retirement fund vehicles available to individuals, including pension 
funds, provident funds, retirement annuity funds, pension preservation funds and provident 
preservation funds. Historically, each of these funds had a differ ent tax treatment for contributions, 
alongside different rules for withdrawals.  
Since 2012, the South African retirement fund regime has been undergoing fundamental reforms, 
as initiated in a series of discussion papers since 2012, starting with Strengthening retirement 
savings: An overview of proposals announced in the 2012 Budget, w hich summarised the intended 
policy direction for future retirement reforms. To date we have been able to:  
 Create tax free savings account opportunities for individuals from 1 March 2015;  
 Harmonise the tax treatment of contributions to the different types of funds from 1 March 2016;  
 Increase preservation at retirement through annuitisation effective from 1 March 2021; and  
 Implement reforms to lower charges and improve defaults, governance, and market conduct.  
The discussion paper entitled Preservation, portability and governance for retirement funds, 
published on 21 September 2012, and the paper entitled Retirement reform proposals for further 
consultation, published on 27 February 2013, both included options t o increase the level of pre 
retirement preservation. Data from retirement fund administrators and SARS suggests that many of 
these withdrawals are taking place, notwithstanding the potentially high tax rates that are applied.  
 
Q: LEGISLATION  Rationale for the two pot system  
A: The amendments in the draft bill seek to implement the remaining pre retirement preservation 
proposal, as part of the longer term retirement reform project. There are two primary concerns with 
the current design of the retirement system. The first is th e lack of preservation before retirement, 
which has been highlighted in previous discussion papers. Individuals can access their pension 
funds and provident funds, in full, when changing or leaving a job. In some cases, it can create an 
incentive to leave employment to gain access to those funds in the short term, putting their long 
term retirement savings, and eventual ability to maintain their standard of living at retirement at 
risk.  
The second issue is that some households in financial distress have assets within their retirement 
fund(s) that are not accessible, even in case of emergencies. This issue has become more 
prominent since the COVID 19 pandemic, with numerous calls for finan cially distressed individuals 
to be given some level of access to their retirement funds to alleviate financial hardship.  
On 15 December 2021, Government published a discussion document entitled Encouraging South 
Africans to save more for retirement, which proposed a new retirement fund regime that aims to 
address both concerns � this would be in the form of a �two pot� syste m for retirement savings. 
Individuals can contribute to a one third �savings pot� which is accessible without changing their 
employment status, and a two third �retirement pot� which must be preserved until retirement. The 
aim is to have a system that will  allow resources to be available when needed, but that will also 
increase the overall level of savings that are dedicated to retirement.  
Government has consulted widely with labour unions, fund administrators, industry, and other 
experts, before finalising the draft legislative proposals. It is recognised that in allowing for a 
withdrawal option, many funds may face liquidity risks on imple mentation. It is also recognised that 
any new system will take time to implement, as they require changes to systems and fund rules, 
and will also mean that funds will face new and higher costs. Many workers have low levels of 
savings, as they have accesse d all their previous savings when they changed jobs or resigned from 
their jobs. For example, according to ASISA, about 61% of fund members had an average of R37 000 
or less in total retirement savings (July 2020). The proposal does not include allowing im mediate 
access to retirement funds, but rather moves to a system that can more adequately cater for 
emergencies in the future but should also increase preservation to improve retirement outcomes.  
The key risks that counteract allowing immediate withdrawals include:  
a) Risk of members drawing down a substantial part of their retirement saving, leaving them more 
vulnerable when they retire;  
b) Risk of lower investment returns for members as more funds are withdrawn and less of their 
savings are invested;  
c) Risk to financial viability of specific funds and fund types that were not designed to 
accommodate such a withdrawal; and  
d) Risk of liquidity runs on some funds alongside a negative shock on asset prices on the 
implementation date or soon after.  
 
Q: Are there any economic factors that could impact the effectiveness of the Two Pot Retirement 
system?  
A: Economic factors such as inflation, interest rates, and overall market performance could 
influence the growth and value of retirement savings in both pots. Furthermore, broader economic 
conditions, such as recessions or significant job loss, could lead more individuals to early access 
to their Savings Pot, affecting their long term retirement security.  
 
Q: Can I transfer a retirement annuity (RA) from one service provider to my pension fund after Two 
Pot is introduced?  
A: No. You cannot transfer from a pension to an RA but you can transfer from one RA to another RA.  
 
Q: If I have 5 retirement contracts valued at R300 000 each at the date of Two Pot implementation, 
does this mean that each of the 5 retirement contracts will have a vested pot of R30 000?  
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Can I make a lump sum deposit into the retirement pot?  
A: Yes, you are allowed to make lump sum deposits, however you cannot direct funds to a specific 
pot only. One third will always be allocated to your Savings Pot and two thirds will always be 
allocated to your Retirement Pot. Both pots are invested the sam e way.  
  
Q: Will the money in my Savings Pot earn interest?  
A: Yes, the money in your Savings Pot will remain invested.  
 
Q: What happens if I choose to not withdraw any of my retirement savings?  
A: The money in your Savings Pot is meant for emergencies. If you choose not to withdraw your 
Savings Pot money it will continue to grow. You can then withdraw it as cash (you will have to pay tax 
and fees) when you reach retirement age.  
 
Q: Will the one third Savings Pot contributions still be tax deductible for income tax?  
A: Yes  the full contribution (one third Savings Pot and two thirds Retirement Pot) is tax deductible.  
 
Q: How does the Savings Pot payout at retirement?  
A: The Savings Pot will be similar to the one third amount you can access as cash when you retire. 
You can withdraw all your Savings Pot money at retirement. Tax rules will apply.  
 
Q: If I withdraw from my Savings Pot before retirement, will I still be able to access my R550 000 tax 
free at retirement?  
A: Under the current legislation, any withdrawals on exit taken in cash accumulate to your tax free 
portion at retirement. However, this changes in the new system with Savings Pot withdrawals. 
Savings Pot withdrawals are taxed under a different system as i t is seen as taxable income. When 
you withdraw from your Savings Pot you pay tax at your marginal rate. It doesn't form part of your 
R550 000 tax free at retirement. Members who continue to access their savings pot during their 
working lifetime will still be able to access the retirement tax free lump sum of R550 000.  
 
Q: If I withdraw from my Vested Pot before retirement, will I still be able to access my R550 000 tax 
free at retirement?  
A: Withdrawals from the Vested Pot will follow old rules and therefore withdrawals will accumulate 
to your tax free portion at retirement.  
 
Q: If I draw all of my savings can I still take a lump sum at retirement?  
A: A member's benefit at retirement is equal to the sum of the Vested Pot plus the savings pot plus 
the Retirement Pot. At retirement you will be able to take one third of your Vested Pot plus any 
Savings Pot money in cash. If there are no funds in your Sa vings Pot you can only take one third of 
your Vested Pot.  
Any previous provident vested money (pre 1 March 2021 money) can also be taken fully in cash at 
retirement.  

  
Q: I'm on disability, will I be taxed on the withdrawal amount?  
A: All Savings Pot withdrawals are taxed as income in the hands of a member. You will be taxed at 
your marginal tax rate.  
 
Q: Does the money in the Savings Pot apply to in fund preserved members?  
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Will SARS have the opportunity to withdraw outstanding taxes from the withdrawal amount?  
A: SARS will require a customer to pay any additional outstanding taxes (referred to as an IT88). 
These outstanding taxes include outstanding administrative penalties and arrear assessed tax 
owing to SARS. Finanacial Institution is required to act on any i nstruction from SARS to pay 
outstanding taxes and/or penalties before paying the balance.  
 
Q: Will the Savings Pot be invested differently from the retirement portion?  
A: No. The default will remain unchanged as this money is intended to be your retirement money.  
 
Q: If I move overseas can I access my full pension  that amount prior to Two Pot and then after Two 
Pot?  
A: The current emigration rules will apply to your pension fund savings prior and post two pot. The 
current rules indicate that individuals who are part of a retirement fund would be eligible to receive 
lump sum benefits only upon meeting the requirements of ceasing to be a South African tax 
resident and maintaining such non residency status for a minimum of three consecutive years. This 
threeyear stipulation signifies that individuals who decide to emigrate will need to wait for at least 
three years befor e they become eligible to withdraw their retirement savings.  
 
Q: If I am in South Africa on a work permit, will I be able to access my retirement savings when my 
permit expires?  
A: Yes, upon expiry of the work permit, access will be permitted.  
 
Q: How does the new rule apply to paid up Retirement Annuities?  
A: As there is no contribution there won't be a split of contributions going forward. Members can 
access 10% of their investment capped at R30 000 which will be in the Savings Pot.  
 
Q: How will this legislation impact the overall Section 14 transfer process going forward?  
A: Overall the process won't change but the forms will change. Currently the money from one 
investment moves to another. While the transfer is in progress the member can access their 
Savings Pot. Once the process is approved, the money will move over into the respective pots and 
access will not be permitted until the respective pots are created.  
  
Q: What happens in the event of a divorce?  
A: Divorce orders can currently be applied against a member's retirement savings and this does not 
change in the new Two Pot world. The claim will be effected pro rata across all of the member's 
pots. It is critical that you notify us if you are in the pro cess of getting divorced.  
 
Q: Do I need spouse consent before accessing the Savings Pot portion if I am married in community 
of property?  
A: No.  
 
Q: When may I NOT be able to access my Savings Pot?  
A: A member may not be able to access their Savings Pot under the following situations:  
1. They have already accessed their Savings Pot in that particular tax year  
2. The member or the non member spouse have notified Finanacial Institution that they have 
instituted divorce proceedings and therefore the member's Savings Pot has been frozen  
3. They have less than R2 000 in their Savings Pot.  
 
Q: How will Housing Loans work in a Two Pot world?  
A: Housing loan applications will be capped at 65% of the value of all your pots (Retirement, 
Savings and Vested pots).  
 
Q: Will there be any changes to existing pension regulations to accommodate the Two Pot 
Retirement system?  
A: Yes. Implementing the new Two Pot Retirement system regulations will result in amendments to 
the Income Tax Act and the Pension Fund Act.  
 
Q: How will implementing the Two Pot Retirement system impact the regulatory environment, 
particularly around the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) and Regulation 28?  
A: This new system will affect all types of retirement funds � i.e., pension, provident, retirement 
annuity, and preservation funds. Provident fund members over 55 years old on 1 September 2024 
can continue with the old system or adopt the new one. Regulat ion 28 is not being changed. 
Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act sets limits to where people should invest their retirement 
savings. It makes sure that you invest in different assets or types of assets so that you don't take 
unnecessary investment risks . 
 
Q: When will the Two Pot Retirement system be implemented, and how will it impact my retirement 
planning?  
A: The Two Pot Retirement system is set to go live on 1 September 2024. When it does become 
available it could impact your retirement planning by providing more frequent access to a portion of 
your investment called the savings pot. However, the primary pu rpose of the change is to 
discourage early withdrawals from your retirement savings and promote long term financial 
security.  
 
Q: Can I choose different funds for my savings pot in the Two Pot Retirement system?  
A: This will likely be retirement fund dependent. However, it is important to remember that your full 
contribution towards a retirement fund should be invested with a focus on the longer term return, 
and even with the introduction of the Two Pot Retirement  system, it must be emphasised that the 
main purpose of a retirement fund is to save and invest for retirement in the long term.  
 
Q: How does the Two Pot Retirement system affect the default portfolios the trustees select?  
A: Most retirement fund members are invested within the default portfolios selected by the 
trustees. We expect this to stay the same with the introduction of the Two Pot Retirement system. 
Trustees are responsible for ensuring that appropriate defaults are  set for members for retirement 
funding.  
 
Q: How will the Two Pot Retirement system impact the accessibility of my funds and the annuity 
options available to me?  
A: The Two Pot Retirement system will allow more frequent access to a portion of your retirement 
savings, known as the savings pot. However, you will not be able to access the retirement pot which 
will contain two thirds of your contributions until you rea ch retirement age. It will have no impact on 
your annuity options at retirement.  
 
Q: What should my investment strategy be under the Two Pot Retirement system?  
A: The investment strategy in your Finanacial Institution retirement fund will not change on 
implementation of the Two Pot system. It's important to remember that the primary goal of these 
funds is to provide for retirement. As a result, an investment stra tegy should align with this goal. 
This means a portfolio focused on achieving CPI +5% type returns is essential for the full retirement 
benefit, even under the Two Pot Retirement system.  
  
Q: What are the tax implications of the TwoPot Retirement system, particularly concerning lump 
sum withdrawals from the savings pot?  
A: The Two Pot Retirement system has specific tax implications, especially regarding lump sum 
withdrawals from the savings pot. If you decide to withdraw from your savings pot before 
retirement, remember that these amounts are considered part of your taxab le income for that tax 
year. The withdrawn amount will be taxed according to your applicable marginal tax rate, whether 
the withdrawal is a smaller or larger lump sum.  
Any withdrawals from your Savings Pot at retirement will be subject to retirement tax tables which 
includes R550 000 tax free.  
 
Q: What happens to my tax free portion if my savings pot is empty at retirement?  
A: If your savings pot is empty at retirement, it will mean that you will not be able to access any 
lump sum at retirement. Your retirement pot will be used to purchase income. It is important to 
note that if you still have a vested pot at retirement, you can access some of this balance as a lump 
sum.  
 
Q: How will the tax due from the savings pot be calculated and deducted under the Two Pot 
Retirement system?  
A: At this stage, it has been confirmed that any pre retirement savings pot withdrawals will be taxed 
at your marginal tax rate, which the administrator will facilitate before making the payment. The 
process for applying for the tax rate at this stage has yet to be finalised.  
 
Q: How will the Two Pot Retirement system affect me if I have already retired when implemented?  
A: The Two Pot Retirement system primarily affects how future retirement fund contributions are 
managed. Therefore, it's unlikely to affect those who have already retired and are no longer 
contributing to their retirement funds.  
 
Q: Can my financial adviser assist me with navigating the Two Pot Retirement system, and what 
resources are available to help me make informed decisions?  
A: Yes, Finanacial Institution financial advisers will be able to assist you in navigating the Two Pot 
Retirement system. Finanacial Institution is taking active steps to ensure its advisers are well 
informed and equipped to guide you through these changes . In addition, Finanacial Institution has a 
dedicated Two Pot retirement content hub with a wealth of resources to help you understand this 
new retirement funding system, to ensure that you stay on track with your long term financial plans.  
 
Q: Can I transfer funds from my current retirement savings plan into the Two Pot system?  
A: All savings as of the effective date will be allocated to your vested pot, and the existing rules will 
apply. Ten percent of the vested pot, capped at R30 000, will be transferred to your Savings Pot. This 
move to the Two Pot Retirement System will be a utomatic for all retirement fund customers, except 
for those who were 55 at 1 March 2021, and those who are members of legacy annuity retirement 
funds.  
 
Q: How will the Two Pot Retirement system affect my retirement benefits if I change jobs 
frequently?  
A: Retirement annuity funds will not be impacted when changing jobs. For pension and provident 
funds  under the new system  when you leave your employer you must decide about each of your 
vested and savings pots separately. It's important to note that yo ur retirement pot cannot be 
withdrawn; it must be preserved in the retirement fund of your choice Speaking to a financial 
adviser will be important to ensure that the most appropriate decision is made. One of the main 
advantages of the new Two Pot Retireme nt system is that you can build up your retirement pot over 
your entire career to ensure a reasonable retirement income.  
 
Q: What is the process for dealing with disputes or complaints?  
A: The Two Pot system is an amendment to the South African retirement fund system. It does not 
change the current dispute or complaints processes that have already been established via the 
Pension Fund and the FAIS Acts.  
 
Q: How secure is my investment under the Two Pot Retirement system against market volatility and 
economic downturns?  
A: At this stage there are minor changes from an investment point of view., Regulation 28 remains 
unchanged. It's important to note that the investment security of both pots will depend on various 
factors, including investment strategy, diversification, an d the overall performance of the financial 
markets. Market volatility and economic downturns can impact on the value of investments in both 
pots. However, the mandatory preservation of the retirement pot until retirement protects by 
allowing more time for potential recovery and growth.  
 
Q: What constitutes an emergency?  
A: The legislation does not explicitly outline the circumstances or criteria that would qualify as an 
emergency. For each person, the definition of emergency will differ. However, it is important to 
ensure that you have some savings aside, over and above y our retirement fund savings, to assist 
with rainy day fund for unforeseen expenses. Withdrawals from the savings pot should be 
infrequent, if at all as ultimately, this is your retirement savings.  
 
Q: How often will I be able to access my funds?  
A: Under the Two Pot Retirement system, withdrawals from the savings pot can be made only once 
per year of tax assessment (between 1 March and 28 February yearly). There will be a minimum 
withdrawal amount of R2 000 before costs and tax but no maximum with drawal amount. It is, 
however, important to note that if you do not access it, it continues to build up over time, and any 
unused Savings Pot balance will be your lump sum benefit at retirement.  
 
Q: How will I be able to access my funds?  
A: Retirement fund members must apply directly to their Fund. Further details on the Finanacial 
Institution claims process will be shared as we get closer to the effective date. When accessing 
your savings pot, you must consider the following:  
 A minimum of R2 000 or 10% of your savings in the vested component can be withdrawn; capped 
at R30 000. If you have less than R2 000 in the savings pot, you cannot withdraw.  
 You can only withdraw once per tax year, i.e., between 1 March and 28 February each year.  
 There is no maximum withdrawal amount.  
 You will be charged an administration fee for the withdrawal, which will be deducted from the 
amount you want to withdraw.  
 You will pay tax on the savings pot withdrawal benefit based on your individual marginal tax rate as 
supplied by SARS.  
 In a pension or provident fund, on resignation, you can only cash out your savings pot if it is less 
than R2 000 or you have not already accessed your one withdrawal per tax year. Otherwise, you will 
be required to preserve this benefit in the same way y ou will preserve your retirement pot benefit.  
 
Q: I have multiple retirement vehicles (one with my current employer and one in my personal 
capacity) � who will keep track of my withdrawals?  
A: Each fund will keep track of every withdrawal and must keep you informed.  
 
Q: How will the Two Pot Retirement system affect housing loans and sureties?  
A: At this stage, if your fund enables it, the proposed legislation indicates that members can apply 
for home loans against the value of their retirement savings. Further clarity around the process, 
including existing housing loans, and impact on the savin gs must still be provided. We will share 
further information as clarity is provided.  
 
Q: How will divorce orders be affected by the Two Pot Retirement system?  
A: Allowance has been made for divorce orders to be effected against a member's retirement fund. 
However, further clarity is still required before implementation around which pots can be included 
and how the divorce benefit will be processed.  
 
Q: I'll have access to all my retirement savings.  
A: When the Two Pot Retirement System goes into effect, retirement fund members will only have 
access to the money that's in the Savings Component. This is a new system, so to make sure you're 
not starting from zero, 10% of your existing retirement savings  (up to a maximum of R30 000) will be 
moved into that Savings Component (or "pot"). This transfer will only happen once. Going forward, 
your Savings Component will be funded by the allocation of one third of your total ongoing fund 
contributions.  
 
Q: My retirement savings will disappear when the Two Pot Retirement System kicks in.  
A: There's no need to panic. Your existing retirement savings will be fully protected and will stay 
exactly as and where they are in your current retirement funds. The Two Pot Retirement System's 
rules will only apply to your future retirement contributions, starting on the effective date.  
 
Q: Only employee contributions go into the accessible pot.  
A: The Two Pot Retirement reforms will apply to all contributions to your fund, so it will apply to 
both employee and employer contributions.  
 
Q: I can withdraw from all my pots when I quit my job.  
A: The Two Pot Retirement System introduces mandatory preservation. In other words, it forces you 
to preserve a portion (two thirds) of your future retirement savings until the day you retire. Under the 
old/current system, you could access all your retirem ent savings if you resigned or were dismissed 
or retrenched. Under the Two Pot Retirement System, you can only access your existing (the 
balance as at the effective date) and Savings (subject to accessibility rules) Components when you 
leave your job befor e retirement.  
 
Q: I can access my retirement savings to enhance my lifestyle.  
A: There's been a lot of discussion around the Savings Pot (or Savings Component), but early access 
to your retirement savings is the exact opposite of the real intention of the Two Pot Retirement 
System. Early access will only be granted once a year, and it should only be accessed for 
emergencies. It's not intended for lifestyle enhancements � which is why you'll be taxed your 
marginal rate of tax on any withdrawals from the Savings Component.  
 
Q: I won't pay tax on withdrawals from my Savings Component.  
A: Any withdrawals from your Savings Component will be taxed at your normal marginal rate of 
income tax rate.  
 
Q: I can replace the money I withdraw from my Savings Pot as soon as I'm financially stable again.  
A: Your retirement savings are neither designed nor intended to be transactional savings accounts. 
No money that you withdraw from your Savings Component can be directly replaced at a later 
point. The only way to replace that money is by increasing your fu ture contributions over time or 
onceoff voluntary contributions, which would not be directly allocated to the Savings Pot. Only 
onethird of the amount would go to the Savings Pot and the other two thirds would go to the 
Retirement Pot.  
 
Q: I will need to elect to join the Two Pot Retirement System.  
A: The move to the proposed Two Pot Retirement System will be automatic for all retirement fund 
members, so no action is required. Provident fund members who were older than 55 on 1 March 
2021 will be the only exception, they will be given an option to opt  in. 
  
Q: What is the 'de minimis' rule?  
A: If the two thirds (2/3) of your total pension that you have to 'annuitize' is less R165,000, you can 
take it as a lump sum. After March 2021, the de minimis is applied to two thirds of your pension 
plus two thirds of your provident funds saved after tha t date (your non vested benefits).  
Now, the de minimums applies to two thirds pension + two thirds non vested provident benefits + 
retirement component. If that's under R165,000, you can get all of that as a lump sum. This applies 
separately to each retirement account you have.  
 
Q: What is seeding?  
A: Instead of having to wait for your savings pot contributions to build up a sizeable balance in that 
pot, 10% of your existing savings (up until 31 August 2024) is going to be transferred into your 
savings pot, but at a maximum of R30,000.  
Each one of your savings instruments  a retirement annuity (RA), preserver, pension fund, provident 
fund, even preserved assets in a certain fund  will be 'seeded'. This is the term used to capture the 
idea of 10% being transferred into the savings pot o f each retirement product.  
 
Q: What about people over the age of 55 years?  
A: If you were 55 or older on 1 March 2021, you'll have 12 months to opt those savings into two pots 
for any provident fund savings you had in 2021 that are still in the same fund. This applies from 1 
September 2024.  
You shouldn't opt in if you want to keep your right to a full lump sum withdrawal at retirement and 
not have future contributions going to a 'retirement component' that has to be used to buy an 
annuity.  
You should opt in if you want immediate access to a savings component without needing to leave 
your job.  
If you change jobs or your employer moves your provident fund to another provider, your 
contributions to the new fund will automatically be part of the two pot system, so the decision is 
then made for you.  
 
Q: Divorce  
A: If a divorce order has been filed, the fund can restrict savings pot withdrawals if they believe that 
withdrawals could result in insufficient funds being left to settle the divorce order claim.  
 
Q: Employer debt  
A: If an employee has been involved in any criminal activity and the employer is suing that 
employee, the employer can issue a notice to the fund to restrict savings pot withdrawals. The fund 
can then restrict withdrawals if they think there'll be insuffic ient funds left over to settle the 
employer's claim. However, in this case, restrictions can only last 12 months. The claims can take 
long to settle in court, so it's up to the employer to resolve the claim as soon as possible.  
 
Q: What is the impact on emigration regarding retirement funds?  
A: You need to wait three years to access your retirement funds after you emigrate. This rule is to 
avoid 'staged' or fake emigrations to access funds, protecting the integrity of SA's retirement 
system. Under the two pot system, this rule applies to all p ots immediately after losing SA 
residency or work permit. However, before losing residency, you could still withdraw your vested 
component and savings component.  
 
Q: How will the accessible savings pot be initially funded?  
A: The accessible savings pot will be 'seeded' by taking 10% of your savings on 1 September, up to a 
maximum of R30,000, and moving it into the savings pot. This allows for immediate withdrawal if 
needed.  
 
Q: How do maintenance claims affect retirement fund withdrawals?  
A: If a maintenance order has been issued against a retirement fund, the fund can restrict a 
member's savings withdrawals. This applies when there is formal written notice from the 
investigating officer authorizing the restriction.  
 
Q: How is the savings pot taxed?  
A: If you withdraw from your savings component, you'll be taxed at your income tax rate. If you don't 
withdraw, you'll still get tax benefits such as tax deductibility and tax free growth. At retirement, 
lump sum withdrawals are taxed according to the reti rement tax table, with up to R550,000 being 
taxfree.  
 
Q: Should I invest my pots differently?  
A: It's recommended not to change your investment strategy. Even with potential withdrawals, 
staying invested in a balanced or aggressive strategy typically yields better returns over time 
compared to a conservative approach.  
 
Q: How can I check if I'm registered for tax?  
A: You can check your tax registration status through various SARS channels, including the SARS 
Online Query System (SOQS), SARS MobiApp, SARS WhatsApp, USSD, or SMS.  
 
Q: What are the key features of the Savings Component (Pot 1)?  
A: The Savings Component will initially be funded with 10% of your Vested Component value 
(capped at R30,000). One third of future contributions go here. You can access this annually, with a 
minimum withdrawal of R2,000. Withdrawals before retirement are t axed at your marginal tax rate.  
 
Q: What are the key features of the Retirement Component (Pot 2)?  
A: Twothirds of future contributions go to the Retirement Component. It can only be accessed at 
retirement or death and must be used to purchase a pension for regular income after retirement.  
 
Q: What is the Vested Component (Pot 3)?  
A: The Vested Component contains your existing retirement fund contributions, minus the amount 
transferred to the Savings Component. Current access rules apply, allowing access if you leave 
your employer before retirement.  
 
Q: What are the retirement tax rates?  
A: The retirement tax rates are:  
 0% on taxable income from R1 to R550,000  
 18% on taxable income from R550,001 to R770,000  
 R39,600 + 27% on taxable income from R770,001 to R1,155,000  
 R143,550 + 36% on taxable income above R1,155,001  
 
Q: What are the marginal tax rates?  
A:  
| 1  237 000 | 18% of taxable income |  
| 237 101  370 500 | 42 678 + 26% of taxable income above 237 100 |  
| 370 501  512 800 | 77 362 + 31% of taxable income above 370 500 |  
| 512 801  673 000 | 121 475 + 36% of taxable income above 512 800 |  
| 673 001  857 900 | 179 147 + 39% of taxable income above 673 000 |  
| 857 901  1 817 000 | 251 258 + 41% of taxable income above 857 900 |  
| 1 817 001 and above | 644 489 + 45% of taxable income above 1 817 000 |  
 
Q: The two pot retirement system �what to expect on 1 September 2024  
A: With the new two pot retirement system taking effect in six weeks, members of retirement funds 
should ensure that they understand the implications of the system, according to Adri 
Messerschmidt, senior policy advisor at the Association for Savings and I nvestment South Africa 
(ASISA). The only retirement fund members who will not automatically become part of the new two 
pot system are:  
 �legacy� retirement annuity members, and  
 members of provident or provident preservation funds who were 55 years or older on 1 March 
2021 and who are still members of the same provident fund when the new system kicks in. 
Messerschmidt says retirement fund members expecting to withdraw some of th eir money once 
the new system kicks in on 1 September 2024 should also familiarise themselves with the 
withdrawal requirements and processes. She emphasises that the new two pot system is being 
implemented to give members access to some of their retirement  savings in times of great need 
while, at the same time, forcing the preservation of two thirds of retirement savings from 1 
September 2024. �It is important to understand that absolutely nothing changes for retirement 
savings made until 31 August 2024. Yo ur current rights remain protected in the vested pot, and 
there is no need to panic and resign to cash in your retirement savings made before the 
implementation of the two pot system.�  
Messerschmidt adds that 10%, to a maximum of R30 000, will be moved from your existing 
retirement savings (your vested pot) into your new savings pot from 1 September 2024. This is a 
onceoff event aimed at giving you the opportunity to withdraw some money  should you find 
yourself in great financial difficulty.  
 
Q: What to consider before submitting a withdrawal application  
A: Messerschmidt explains that withdrawals are not allowed without a tax directive from the South 
African Revenue Service (SARS). �While retirement fund administrators will apply for a tax directive 
on your behalf, they can only do this if you have a valid  income tax registration number. If you are 
not currently registered as a taxpayer, you need to register before applying for a withdrawal.� 
Messerschmidt points out that while you may not currently earn enough to pay tax, a withdrawal 
from your savings pot  is considered income, and if it pushes you into a higher tax bracket, you will 
have to pay tax on the withdrawal. This is why you must be registered as a taxpayer before 
submitting a savings pot withdrawal. She cautions taxpayers who owe SARS taxes, penal ties or 
interest on outstanding taxes to expect that these debts may be settled from any savings pot 
withdrawals. �This may mean a much lower payout than you had expected.� Once a fund 
administrator has applied for a tax directive, SARS rules state that th e withdrawal process cannot 
be stopped, says Messerschmidt. �You cannot change your mind once you see the tax implications 
of your withdrawal request. It is also important to note that savings pot withdrawals may attract an 
administration fee to be determi ned by your fund�s administrator.� Messerschmidt says it is 
incredibly important to consider the full impact of making a withdrawal and to weigh up whether it 
is really worth dipping into your retirement savings.  
 
Q: How long will the withdrawal process take?  
A: Once the retirement fund has implemented the new system and the fund administrator has 
transferred the �seeding� money into the savings pot, qualifying retirement fund members can 
submit their applications according to the process communicated by their retirement fund or the 
fund administrators. Messerschmidt says once a fund member has submitted the application form 
for a savings pot withdrawal, the following steps will determine how long it will take before the fund 
member receives a payout:  
 Once the retirement fund or the fund administrators receive the application form, a member 
verification process will be activated to prevent fraud. If the personal details on the application 
form do not match the details on the fund�s records, the applic ation will be rejected. To prevent 
unnecessary delays, fund members should verify their details with their retirement funds before 1 
September 2024.  
 If the member has been successfully verified, has provided the information requested on the 
application form and a tax number, and has at least R2 000 available in the savings pot for 
withdrawal, the fund administrator will apply for a tax directive from  SARS.  
 SARS will provide a tax directive indicating how much tax, if any, is payable and also if any 
outstanding taxes, penalties and interest are payable to SARS. Money owed to SARS, together with 
tax payable on the withdrawal, will be deducted from the reques ted withdrawal amount first. The 
fund administrator could also deduct an administration fee.  
 The fund administrator will make these deductions and pay the balance into the member�s bank 
account. The payment will only be made into verified bank accounts to prevent fraud.  
Messerschmidt says that process can take several working days, provided there are no snags, such 
as unverified details or incomplete application forms. In addition, fund administrators are expecting 
large volumes of applications, which is likely to result in delays.  
 
Q: What is the Two Pot Retirement System?  
A: The South African Government is attempting, by the implementation of the Two Pot Retirement. 
System to provide financial relief to its citizens in times of financial distress. The proposed 
implementation date is 1 September 2024. The Two Pot Retirement System enables a member of a 
Pension, Provident, Retirement Annuity or  
Preservation Fund to access a small portion of their retirement savings before retirement in case of 
emergencies. The bulk of your savings will remain invested until you retire.  
 
Q: How will the TwoPot Retirement System work?  
A: Your retirement benefits will be split into three components: a retirement component, a savings 
component, and a vested component.  
VESTED COMPONENT  Existing benefits All existing investments plus future investment growth will 
remain under current fund rules, 10% to maximum of R30 000 transferred to savings component on 
1 September 2024.  
RETIREMENT COMPONENT  Twothirds of future contributions. Used to purchase a pension 
income at retirement. Cannot withdraw from this component unless retiring or value at retirement 
is less than R165 000. (All contributions from 1 September 2024).  
SAVINGS COMPONENT  Seeded once off from vested component plus one third of future 
contributions Before retirement one withdrawal per tax year is allowed. Minimum withdrawal of R 
2000 allowed. At retirement full balance becomes accessible. Withdrawals are taxed at marginal 
rate of person, not pension fund rate, therefore more tax payable. (All contributions from 1 
September 2024).  
 
Q: Example of application of the Two-Pot system for retirement fund member.  
A: Here's an example of the Twopot system for Thando Ndlovu:  
1. Background:  
Thando Ndlovu is 40 years old and has contributed to her current employer pension fund for the 
past 10 years. She made no withdrawals from her pension fund when she moved between 
employers.  
 
2. Initial Investment:  
On 31 August 2024, Thando's investment balance is R450,000, and her monthly net contribution is 
R6000.  
 
3. Implementation of Two pot System:  
On 1 September 2024:  
 R30,000 (R450,000 x 10% = R45,000 but capped at R30,000) is transferred to her savings 
component for immediate access.  
 Her September 2024 contribution is split: R2000 into the savings component and R4000 into the 
retirement component.  
 
4. Investment Value After Split:  
 Vested Component: R420,000 (R450,000 less R30,000 transfer to savings)  
 Retirement Component: R4000 (Two thirds of September 2024 contribution)  
 Savings Component: R32000 (R30,000 + R2000)  
 
5. Projected Investment Value After 5 Years:  
Assuming no salary increase and an inflation related return of 6% per annum:  
 Vested Component: R546,000 (R420,000 X (5 years x 6%))  
 Retirement Component: R312,000 (R4000 X 60 months X (5 years x 6%))  
 Savings Component: R156,000 (R2000 X 60 months X (5 years x 6%))  
Total: R1,014,000  
 
6. Maximum Withdrawal Scenario:  
If Thando withdraws the maximum benefit from the savings pot each year for 5 years:  
 Vested Component: R546,000  
 Retirement Component: R312,000  
 Savings Component: R0.00  
Total: R858,000  
 
7. Tax Implications of Maximum Withdrawal:  
 R156,000 less invested after 5 years towards retirement  
 May move into a higher tax bracket  
 No additional income tax due to pension fund contribution credit being greater than the 
withdrawal benefit  
 
8. Annual Savings Component Available for Withdrawal:  
R25,440 (R2000 x 12 months x 6% per year)  
 
This example demonstrates how the Two pot system works for Thando Ndlovu, showing the initial 
split, projected growth, and potential outcomes of different withdrawal scenarios.  
 
Q: What can I withdraw if I am retrenched?  
A: For Pension and Provident Fund, all savings in your vested component plus your accumulated 
savings in your savings component may be withdrawn. For Retirement Annuities, only your savings 
component may be withdrawn.  
 
Q: Why will I pay tax if I withdraw from my savings component?  
A: If withdrawing from your savings pot, SARS will calculate this as part of your normal annual gross 
income (such as salary, interest, bonus or commission) and not recognize it as part of your lifetime 
tax free Pension fund withdrawal, currently valued at  R550,000. So instead of possibly paying 0% 
income tax, you may now pay either 18%, 26%, 36% or 45% tax, depending on your gross annual 
income.  
 
Q: Does it matter how old I am?  
A: Yes, Provident fund members who were 55 years or older on 1 March 2021 have a choice to:  
1. Contribute to the vested component (until you retire or leave the fund) or  
2. Participate in the two pot system and split all new contributions between savings and retirement 
components. You will then no longer be able to contribute to the vested component.  
 
Q: What about Legacy Retirement Annuities?

specific characteristics in the draft legislation.

55 or older on 1 March 2021). This component is subject to the exi sting rules of the fund.  
Savings component: This is a new component where a portion of the vested component (10%, up to 
R30,000) and one third of future contributions are allocated. Members can make one withdrawal 
per year from this component, subject to certain conditions.  
Retirement component: This is a new component where two thirds of future contributions are 
allocated. Funds in this component can only be accessed upon retirement as an annuity, except in 
specific circumstances like emigration or small balances.

transfers, with the Commissioner's determination being final.  
 
Q: What are the overall goals of the "two pot" system reform?  
A: The "two pot" system aims to:  
Improve retirement outcomes: By encouraging preservation of retirement savings in the retirement 
component, it aims to ensure individuals have sufficient income during retirement.  
Provide financial flexibility: The savings component allows individuals to access a portion of their 
retirement savings for emergencies or other needs before retirement.  
Simplify retirement rules: The system aims to create a more harmonized and understandable 
framework for retirement savings across different fund types.  
 
Q: What are the specific rules regarding transfers between the different components within a 
retirement fund or to another fund?  
A: Paragraph 6B of the Second Schedule, as introduced by the Bill, outlines the rules for transfers 
between components:  
Within the same fund: Members can transfer funds from the savings component or the vested 
component to the retirement component.  
To another fund: Transfers from the savings, vested, or retirement components to similar 
components in another fund are allowed only upon termination of membership in the transferring 
fund or under specific circumstances (e.g., emigration). All remaining c omponents must be 
transferred to the same receiving fund.  
Deductions: Transfers from the savings or vested component to the retirement component (either 
within the same fund or to another fund) are fully deductible for tax purposes.  
 
Q: How is the "savings withdrawal benefit" defined and what are the conditions for withdrawing it?  
A: The "savings withdrawal benefit" is defined as a portion of a member's share in the savings 
component that they elect to withdraw before termination of membership. The following conditions 
apply:  
One withdrawal per year: Members are limited to one withdrawal from the savings component per 
year of assessment, regardless of the number of funds they belong to. However, if a member has 
multiple contracts within the same fund, they can make one withdraw al from each contract.  
Minimum withdrawal amount: Each withdrawal must be at least R2,000 (before charges or 
transaction costs).  
Exception for small balances upon termination: If a member terminates their membership and the 
remaining balance in their savings component is less than R2,000, they can withdraw the full 
amount.  
 
Q: How is employees' tax treated for "savings withdrawal benefits"?  
A: Retirement funds are required to deduct employees' tax from "savings withdrawal benefits" at a 
fixed rate determined by the Commissioner.

Q: How are contributions allocated for defined benefit funds?  
A: For defined benefit funds, the allocation to the retirement and savings components is based on 
the member's "pensionable service" as defined in the fund's rules. If a defined benefit fund cannot 
allocate contributions based on "pensionable service," it can use a reasonable method approved by 
the FSCA.  
 
Q: Are there any exceptions to the "twopot" system rules?

1. Public sector funds and private sector funds;
2. Defined benefit funds ("DB Funds") and defined contribution funds ("DC Funds"); and
3. Pension funds, provident funds, pension preservation funds, provident preservation funds and retirement annuity funds.

Q: Which funds are excluded from the TwoPot Retirement System?
A: 1. Legacy retirement annuities will be excluded. These are retirement annuity contracts held by a member, entered into before 1 September 2024 with a preuniversal life or universal life construct, subject to such conditions as the Financial Sector Conduct Authority may determine.
2. Beneficiary funds.
3. Unclaimed Benefits Funds.

Q: Which members will be excluded from the TwoPot Retirement System?

Q: How will current accumulated retirement savings be impacted?
A: A member's current accumulated retirement savings (i.e. accumulated prior to 1 September 2024) less onceoff seed capital (see below), will form part of the new Vested Component. A member's current rights of access to these benefits and the manner in which these benefits are taxed will carry through into the new system. Members will consequently have vested rights of access to the benefits in the Vested Component, which will include recognition of all the rights relating to their accumulated Vested and NonVested benefits. Contributions made from 1 September 2024 onwards will be allocated to the Savings Component and Retirement Component.

Q: What is 'Seed Capital', and what does this mean for the starting value in the Savings Component?
A: Seed Capital is a portion of a member's accumulated retirement savings as at 31 August 2024. The Seed Capital will be transferred onceoff into the member's Savings Component on or after 1 September 2024. This will serve as a starting balance to the Savings Component. Seed Capital will be calculated as 10% of the accumulated retirement savings as at 31 August 2024, capped at R30 000. A member's Vested benefits and NonVested benefits as at 31 August 2024 will be reduced proportionately by the value of the Seed Capital deducted and allocated to the Savings Component.

Q: How will contributions be split after 1 September 2021?
A: From 1 September 2024, onethird of a member's retirement contributions (less charges and premiums) will be allocated to their Savings Component and twothirds will be allocated to their Retirement Component. Any investment returns earned on the retirement contributions after 1 September 2024 onwards will accumulate in the component that the contributions are allocated to.

Q: Will the member have the option to direct Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) to the Savings Component?
A: Members will not be able to direct 100% of AVCs into the Savings Component after 1 September 2024. Onethird of the AVCs will go into the Savings Component, and the remaining balance (twothirds) of the AVCs made will go into the Retirement Component.

Q: Which transfers between components will be allowed?
A: Within the same fund (intrafund reallocations):From a Vested Component to a Retirement Component.From a Savings Component to a Retirement Component.
Between different funds (interfund transfers):
Transfers of the same type of components (likeforlike) to another fund:From the Vested Component in Fund A to the Vested Component in Fund B.From the Savings Component in Fund A to the Savings Component in Fund B.From the Retirement Component in Fund A to the Retirement Component in Fund B.
Transfers to the Retirement Component of another fund:From the Vested Component in Fund A to the Retirement Component in Fund B.From the Savings Component in Fund A to the Retirement Component in Fund B.
Interfund transfers (between different funds) will only be allowed when a member terminates their membership in the fund, resigns or retires from their respective retirement fund. If a member chooses to make an interfund transfer, all three components will need to be transferred at the same time.
The above transfers may be made taxfree. Any decision taken by a member to transfer or reallocate benefits from their Savings/Vested Component to their Retirement Component should only be taken with appropriate financial advice, as the access rights of the Retirement Component will then prevail.

Q: How will deductions in terms of the Pension Funds Act be applied to the three components?
A: Section 37D deductions as contained in the Pension Funds Act will be made proportionally from all three components  Vested, Savings and Retirement Components. This will apply to deductions such as maintenance orders and divorce awards.

Q: What are the current rules affecting a member's retirement savings following the T-Day retirement reform?
A: Currently, as a result of the T-Day changes effective from 1 March 2021, a member's retirement savings may be split between Vested and NonVested benefits.
The Vested benefits comprise a member's accumulated retirement savings in a provident preservation fund and contributions to a provident fund prior to 1 March 2021 (known as T-Day), plus investment returns earned on these accumulated savings from T-Day onwards. For provident fund members who were 55 or older on T-Day and remain in the same provident fund, all retirement savings contributions made after T-Day (plus investment returns earned after that date) will also comprise Vested benefits. Up to 100% of Vested benefits may be taken as a cash lump sum benefit at retirement.
The NonVested benefits comprise a member's retirement savings in a pension fund, pension preservation fund or retirement annuity fund. They also comprise a member's contributions to a provident fund from T-Day, plus investment returns earned on these savings accumulated from T-Day onwards if that member was younger than 55 on T-Day, or was older than 55 and did not remain in the same provident fund after T-Day. At least twothirds of NonVested benefits must be used to purchase an annuity at retirement (subject to a statutory commutation minimum).

Q: What will happen to the 'Vested' and 'NonVested' benefits after the implementation of the TwoPot Retirement System on 1 September 2024?
A: The TwoPot Retirement System will not affect a member's rights to the retirement savings accumulated up to 31 August 2024. After the implementation date, all the member's current rights of access will coexist with the new TwoPot system, whereby vested rights of members' benefits will be retained. A member's Vested benefits and NonVested benefits (less Seed Capital transferred to the Savings Component) will form part of the member's Vested Component.

Q: What will the new Vested Component contain, and how will it be treated going forward?
A: The Vested Component will comprise members' accumulated retirement savings as at 31 August 2024, less an amount allocated to Seed Capital. It will also include the investment returns earned on these savings from 1 September 2024 onwards. This component will remain split into Vested and NonVested benefits according to the T-Day rules. Investment returns earned on each of the member's Vested and NonVested benefit portions, from 1 September 2024, will continue to be allocated to those respective benefit portions. Any cash lump sum withdrawals (e.g., on resignation/ dismissal/ retrenchment/emigration) from the Vested Component will be taxed in accordance with the applicable lump sum withdrawal tax table.

Once the TwoPot Retirement System is active, there will be no new contributions into the Vested Component. Only members of provident funds who were aged 55 years or older on T-Day, who remain in that same provident fund and who have not elected to be subject to the TwoPot Retirement System may continue to make 100% of their contributions to the Vested Component on or after 1 September 2024. If these members elect to be subject to the TwoPot Retirement System, within a period of 12 months from 1 September 2024. Seed Captial will be determined on the value of their benefits on the last day of the month in which they make their election. In addition their contributions, from the date of their election will be allocated onethird to their Savings Component and twothirds to their Retirement Component.

Q: What preretirement withdrawal benefits will be accessible after the implementation of the TwoPot Retirement System on 1 September 2024? What will the respective tax implications of making such withdrawals be?
A: Vested Component:
Members will have all the same rights of access to the benefits in this component that they do currently.

In the case of pension funds and provident funds, members can still take their full cash lump sum on resignation from employment. In the case of pension and provident preservation funds and Retirement Annuity Funds, members can still take a cash lump sum withdrawal benefit on emigration, cessation of SA tax residence for a period of at least three years or if the member is a nonresident, on the expiry of their SA visa. In the case of Retirement Annuity Funds, members can still take their cash lump sum withdrawal benefit if the value across all their three components is less than R15 000. Any cash lump sum withdrawal benefits taken by the member will be subject to tax in accordance with the lump sum withdrawal tax table (first R27 500 tax free).

Savings Component:
Members will have access to benefits in this component in cash at any time prior to retirement, but such preretirement withdrawals (known as 'Savings Withdrawal Benefits') will be allowed once per tax year only. The minimum amount that can be taken as a cash Savings Withdrawal Benefit is R2 000 before charges and transaction costs are deducted. The cash Savings Withdrawal Benefit will be taxed at the member's marginal tax rate. In the event where a member terminates their membership and this member has already taken their one Savings Withdrawal Benefit within the relevant tax year, an additional withdrawal will be allowed in that same tax year, provided that the balance in the Savings Component is less than R2 000.

Retirement Component:
The benefits in this component must be preserved until retirement and no withdrawals will be allowed from this component before retirement, except under exceptional circumstances. This component will only be accessible at retirement, on the death of the member or prior to retirement if:The member has formally emigrated or ceased their South African tax residency for a period of at least three years or,The member is a nonresident and their SA work or visitor's visa has expired.

Q: Could there be additional transactional costs with regards to the cash Savings Withdrawal Benefits taken from the Savings Component and how will these costs be paid?
A: Yes. The cost of withdrawals will be determined in the rules of the fund.

Q: What will happen when a member retires after the implementation of the TwoPot Retirement System?
A: Vested Component:
At retirement a member will be able to take 100% of the Vested benefits and up to one third of the NonVested benefits as a cash lump sum retirement benefit, subject to tax.
The member will however be required to purchase an annuity with at least two thirds of the NonVested benefits. A new commutation threshold will be introduced for members who wish to take their NonVested benefits in their Vested Component as a cash lump sum retirement benefit. They will only be able to commute their NonVested benefits in full if the member's interest in the Retirement Component plus twothirds of the members NonVested benefits in the Vested Component does not exceed R165 000.

Savings Component:
Any benefits left in the Savings Component at retirement can be taken as a cash lump sum retirement benefit. These benefits may also be transferred to the Retirement Component at retirement and taken in the form of a compulsory annuity.
Retirement Component:
100% of the benefits in the Retirement Component must be taken in the form of a compulsory annuity at retirement. The member will only be able to commute the benefits in their Retirement Component into a cash lump sum retirement benefit if the member's interest in the Retirement Component plus twothirds of the member's NonVested benefits in the Vested Component does not exceed R165 000.
Taxation of benefits taken at retirement:Cash lump sum retirement benefits are subject to tax in accordance with the lump sum retirement tax table (where the first R550 000 is taxfree, applicable across all retirement benefits at all providers).Income received from the compulsory annuities will be subject to tax in accordance with the member's marginal tax rate.

Q: What happens on the member's death after the implementation date?
A: On the death of a member the benefit payable is in respect of all three components and the member's beneficiaries, as determined in terms of section 37C of the Pension Funds Act, may choose to receive the benefits as:A cash lump sum death benefit or;a compulsory annuity or;a combination of both a cash lump sum and a compulsory annuity.

Q: What are the requirements regarding tax directives?
A: It has been confirmed that:Tax directives will be required for Savings Withdrawal Benefits. They must be applied for under an IRP3(a) form. SARS will require a member's tax reference number and annual income for these tax directives.Tax directives will still be required for cash lump sum withdrawal benefits and cash lump sum retirement benefits. Tax directives will also be required for transfers to another fund. These tax directives must be applied for under the revised lump sum forms i.e. Forms A&D, Form B, Form C and Recognitions of Transfer "ROTs" where applicable.Tax directives will not be required for:
   Transfers of Seed Capital to the Savings Component
   Reallocations of benefits in the same fund

Q: Exactly how much money will I be able to withdraw on 1 March 2024?
A: You will be able to withdraw 10% of your savings in your retirement fund on 29 February 2024 to a maximum of R25 000. For example, if you have R50 000 saved in your retirement fund, you will be able to withdraw R5 000.

Q: Will I receive the full amount that I choose to withdraw, into my bank account?
A: No, there will be administration costs involved in every withdrawal from your savings pot. It will also be taxable at your marginal tax rate.

As an example, if you have R5 000 in your savings pot, and request to withdraw the entire amount, you may receive for instance only R3 000 in your bank account as you will pay R1 500 tax (if your marginal tax rate is 30%) and an administration fee of for instance R500 (the fee will depend on the fund, this is for illustration purposes only).

Q: When can I apply for payment of this early withdrawal benefit?
A: The twopot system is proposed to take effect 1 March 2024. However, due to the final legislation not being promulgated yet, fund administrators are not able to finalise their processes yet and as a result it is not possible at this stage to tell exactly when and how you may apply. The period until payment will also depend on various factors such as the volumes of claims to be processed, where your benefit is currently invested (certain investment portfolios have notice periods), whether SARS' systems are ready to issue a tax directive on the payment, whether you have any arrear taxes, and the administrator of your retirement fund's administration processes.

Q: May I withdraw all the money I have in my savings pot every year?
A: Yes, you may. Onethird of your contributions will going forward be allocated to your savings pot (minus administration and insurance costs) and investment return will be added.

If you decide to make a withdrawal, you may withdraw everything in your savings pot as there is no cap on the maximum amount that you can withdraw. However, the minimum amount that can be withdrawn is set at R2 000 per annum. You will be able to withdraw once in every tax year. If you have less than R2 000 in your savings pot, you will not be able to withdraw until the amount in your savings pot is more than R2 000.

Q: Can I still take the rest of my money in the fund in cash when I change jobs?
A: You will not be able to take any amount from your retirement pot when you change jobs. This will be preserved for retirement in terms of government's intention of compulsory preservation and you will only be able to access it at your retirement, and only in the form of a pension.

From your savings pot you will be able to withdraw the balance if you did not take another withdrawal within the same tax year.

The amount in your vested pot may be taken in cash.

Q: When can I retire from my retirement fund?
A: You may retire at any time after you have reached the age when early retirement in your fund is allowed. This is age 55 in most funds.

Q: If I make a withdrawal from my savings pot, will I be able to receive the rest of the money in my savings pot when I resign?
A: You may only make one withdrawal from your savings pot in any tax year (1 March to 28 February of the following year). This means that if you have made a withdrawal in June 2025, and you resign in December 2025, you will need to wait until the next tax year, i.e. March 2026 before you may withdraw the balance from your savings pot. Since you will not be able to withdraw from your retirement pot, it means that when leaving service, you will only receive the money held in your vested pot.

Q: Must I take the seed amount, and must I make a withdrawal every year? May I opt out of the twopot system?
A: There is no provision in the proposals to opt out of the twopot system, but you need not withdraw the seed amount (10% of your savings to a maximum of R25 000) and you may transfer the amount in your savings pot to your retirement pot for your retirement. The frequency of such a transfer will depend on the rules of your fund.

Members older than 55 years on 1 March 2021 may be able to opt out of the twopot system and will then only contribute to the vested pot. Clarity has been requested from National Treasury on this aspect.

Q: Will I be able to withdraw amounts in the savings pot from all my retirement funds, including my retirement annuity and preservation fund?
A: Yes, you will be able to withdraw from all retirement funds of which you are a member, including all your retirement annuity funds and preservation funds. If you are a member of both a pension and provident fund, you may withdraw from both as they are separate legal entities.

Q: If I contribute more than the taxdeductible amount to my retirement fund, how will the twopot system affect me?
A: The tax deductibility of contributions will remain the same  up to 27.5% or R350 000 per annum of your total contributions to the fund, is tax deductible. Contributions in excess of the taxdeductible amount, will also be split onethird to the savings pot and twothirds to the retirement pot.

Q: What will happen with the different pots when I pass away while I am a member of a retirement fund?
A: Your beneficiaries will be able to take the money in all the pots as a lump sum or they may purchase a pension with it, the same as before the implementation of the twopot system.

Q: Can I take the money in all the pots if I am retrenched?
A: National Treasury will implement the twopot system in phases and this question will be dealt with in phase two.

Q: How will it affect my retirement savings if I do not withdraw from my savings pot?
A: If you do not withdraw the R25 000 from your savings pot (assuming you have saved a benefit where 10% is more than R25 000) and you contribute R1 000 per month to your retirement fund, with an expected investment return of 10% and you save for 20 years, you will have accumulated R2 400 134 in your savings pot at retirement. 
In the same scenario, where you withdrew the initial R25 000, you will have R2 231 946 (R168 188 less than you would have had, had you not withdrawn the seed amount).

Q: What is the twopot retirement system?
A: The twopot system is a change to the current laws of retirement funds which will allow members of retirement funds to access a onethird of their future contributions once per year without having to leave employment. The other twothirds of a member�s future contributions will not be accessible to the member until the member retires (at any time after age 55).

Q: What is new about the twopot system?
A: The twopot system introduces three �pots�: a savings pot, a retirement pot, and a vested pot. Everything saved before September 1, 2024, is in the vested pot. The retirement pot and the savings pot are made up from contributions after September 1, 2024. So, from September 1, 2024, a member's record in a fund may have three pots.

Q: What type of investments are affected by the twopot retirement system?
